This is a repository for OpenBlock code with a set of issues associated with it. The issues all describe features created for EveryBlock.com between the day EveryBlock source code was released (June 30, 2009) http://blog.everyblock.com/2009/jun/30/source/ and the day EveryBlock was removed from the Internet (February 7, 2013) http://blog.everyblock.com/2013/feb/07/goodbye/). 

My method was to go to the EveryBlock blog archives (http://blog.everyblock.com/archives/) and organize all of the blog posts into categories. The EveryBlock team was very thorough in describing new features, and these blog posts (and in some cases, the comments) provide great detail.

Issues labeled "bug" are the essentil features that would have to be added. The bulk of this work revolves around posts and comments, which were the main thrust of EveryBlock when it was removed. 

Issues labeled "enhacement" are the features that I think would be good to have in a relaunched openblock-style site.

Most issues are pretty straightforward. The exception is the redesign around neighbor messages-- this was a lot of work with many nuances.

Info about OpenBlock
====================

OpenBlock is a web application and RESTful service that allows users
to browse and search their local area for "hyper-local news" - to see
what's going on recently in the immediate geographic area.

For installation instructions and other documentation, see
http://openblockproject.org/docs/ (or the .rst files in the docs/ directory).

For help, you can try the ebcode group:
http://groups.google.com/group/ebcode
or look for us in the #openblock IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.

OpenBlock began life as the open-source code released by
Everyblock.com in June 2009.  Originally created by Adrian Holovaty
and the Everyblock team, it is now developed as an open-source (GPL)
project by OpenPlans, at http://openblockproject.org.

Funding for the initial creation of Everyblock and the ongoing
development of OpenBlock has been provided by the Knight Foundation
(http://www.knightfoundation.org/).

About this project
==================

This is merely a set of code and issues as a way to capture some thinking about
what a block-level or address-level information service might look like. My initial 
method was to create issues based on new site features that were announced on the 
EveryBlock blog since it first released the code that formed the base of OpenBlock.
In my current position, I am involved with lots of projects in Chicago that tangentially
relate to civic information in urban environments. I welcome input!
